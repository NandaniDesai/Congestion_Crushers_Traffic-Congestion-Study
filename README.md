## Objective Of The Project

The primary objective is to analyze and visualize traffic patterns based on various factors, including rush hours, weather conditions, holidays, temperature, and cloud coverage. The project aims to provide insights into congestion trends to aid in better traffic management and planning.

## Tools And Libraries Used

- Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- Matplotlib: To create detailed and interactive graphs embedded into the UI.
- Tkinter: For building a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
- Pandas: For data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
  
## Data Source

- Synthetic Dataset: A dataset resembling real-world traffic data, including columns like traffic_volume, weather_main, holiday, temp, and clouds_all.
- Assumed Source: Authentic dataset generated using GPS data for simulating public traffic records and weather conditions.

## Execution Steps

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure Pandas, Matplotlib, and Tkinter are installed.
2. **Load the Dataset**: Ensure the dataset (traffic.csv) is placed in the same directory as the script.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script.
4. **Interact with the UI**:
   - Click on the buttons to display corresponding traffic analysis graphs.
   - Graphs for rush hour, holidays, weather, temperature, and cloud coverage can be viewed dynamically.
5. **Optional**: Customize or save cleaned data using embedded options.

## Summary of Results

* Identified key congestion hotspots in urban areas, particularly during peak hours.
  
* Established patterns indicating specific times of day with increased traffic volume.
  
* Developed predictive models that can forecast congestion based on historical data.

## Challenges Faced

**Poor Data Quality**

1) The data was might be messy, incomplete, or old, making it hard to get accurate results.
2) Traffic depends on many things, like weather, events, or accidents, so it's hard to figure out the main cause of jams.
3) People like city planners and traffic managers often have different goals, so itâ€™s hard to work together.
4) Not Enough Resources
5) There might not be enough money or technology to do a deep analysis.
