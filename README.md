**Objective Of The Project**

Analyze urban traffic data to identify congestion hotspots and peak times.

**Tools And Libraries Used**

* Visual Studio Code
* NumPy 
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

**Data Souruce**

* GPS data
* traffic cameras
* sensors

**Execution Steps**

**Modeling**: First we  Develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast traffic congestion based on historical data. Common algorithms include regression analysis, decision trees, and neural networks.

**Validation**: Next we will Validate the models using a separate dataset to ensure accuracy. This step is crucial for assessing the reliability of your predictions.

**Reporting**: Summarize the findings in a report that includes visualizations, key insights, and recommendations for traffic management.

**Implementation**: Work with local authorities to implement traffic management strategies based on our  analysis  such as optimizing traffic signal timings or improving public transportation options.


**Summary of Results**

* Identified key congestion hotspots in urban areas, particularly during peak hours.
  
* Established patterns indicating specific times of day with increased traffic volume.
  
* Developed predictive models that can forecast congestion based on historical data.

**Challenges Faced**

**Poor Data Quality**

1) The data was might be messy, incomplete, or old, making it hard to get accurate results.
2) Traffic depends on many things, like weather, events, or accidents, so it's hard to figure out the main cause of jams.
3) People like city planners and traffic managers often have different goals, so itâ€™s hard to work together.
4) Not Enough Resources
5) There might not be enough money or technology to do a deep analysis.
